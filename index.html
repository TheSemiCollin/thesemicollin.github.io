		<h1>Islam</h1>
		<p>Islam is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotheism">monotheistic</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religions">Abrahamic religion</a>, and currently the second-largest religion in the world, behind only Christianity
		(including both Catholics and Protestants combined). There are currently around 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, making Islam more than one hundred times larger than Judaism. Islam is also
		the fastest-growing of any religion in the world. This is due in large part to the overall youth of the Muslim population compared to other religions.</p>
		<h2>Holy Sites and Cities</h2>
		<p>Islamic holy sites, along with a large portion of the world's Muslim population, tend to be concentrated in the Middle East.</p>
		<h3>Mecca</h3>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Mecca_from_Jabal_Nur.JPG" alt="Mecca seen from Jabal al-Nour" style="height:300px" title="Mecca seen from Jabal al-Nour"></a>
		<p>Mecca is located near the western edge of Saudi Arabia and considered the holiest city in Islam. Only Muslims are allowed to enter Mecca. As one of the Five Pillars of Islam, every adult Muslim who is capable must perform the Hajj (which will be further discussed later on) - a pilgrimage to Mecca - at least once in their lifetime. The Hajj must be completed between the eighth and twelfth days of the last month of the Islamic calendar.</p>
		<p>Hajj is the largest annual gathering in the world, with attendance reaching 3 million in 2012. Additionally, adult Muslims are required to complete the pilgrimage if they are healthy
		and financially stable, as it is a sin to delay it. (Wikipedia)</p>
		
		<h3>Masjid al-Haram</h3>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masjid_al-Haram"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Al-Haram_mosque_-_Flickr_-_Al_Jazeera_English.jpg" alt="Pilgrims at the Masjid al-Haram on Hajj" 
		style="height:300px" title="Pilgrims at the Masjid al-Haram on Hajj"></a>
		<p>Masjid al-Haram ("The Sacred Mosque"), is a large mosque in the city of Mecca, and the largest in Islam. It surrounds the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba">Kaaba</a>,
		the place which all Muslims turn towards each day in prayer, considered by Muslims to be the holiest place on Earth.</p>
		<p>The current structure covers an area of 3,841,000 sq ft including the outdoor and indoor praying spaces and can accommodate up to 820,000 worshipers during the 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj">Hajj period</a>.
		During the Hajj period, the mosque is unable to contain the multitude of pilgrims, who pray on the outlining streets. More than 2 million worshipers gather to pray during Eid prayers. (Wikipedia)</p>
		
		<h2>Holy Text: The Qur'an</h2>
		<p>The Qur'an ("the recitation") is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God (Arabic: Allah). 
		It is widely regarded as the finest piece of literature in the Arabic language. The Qur'an is arranged into suras (chapters) and ayahs (verses).</p>
		<p>Muslims believe the Qur'an was verbally revealed by God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel (Jibril), gradually over a period of approximately 23 years,
		beginning on 22 December 609 CE, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632, the year of his death. Muslims regard the Qur'an as the most important miracle of Muhammad,
		a proof of his prophethood, and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam and ended with Muhammad.
		The word "Qur'an" occurs some 70 times in the text of the Qur'an, although different names and words are also said to be references to the Qur'an. (Wikipedia)</p>
		
		<h2>Prophets and Other Holy Figures</h2>
		<p>Islam shares many prophets with other Abrahamic religions, especially Judaism and Christianity, though their names and messages are often slightly different from accounts in other religions (for example, the Jewish Elisha is called Alyasa, Job is Ayyub, Jesus is Isa, etc...). The same holds true for religious texts. The Torah, which God gave to Moses, is called the Tarwat in Islam, the Psalms are are call the Zabur, and the Gospel of Jesus is called the Injil.</p>
		<p>However, there are seven Jewish prophetesses that aren't mentioned anywhere in the Qur'an.</p>
		
		<h3>Adam</h3>
		<p>Islam shares the story of Adam and Eve with other Abrahamic religions and thus Muslims believe that Adam was the "progenitor of the human race" and the father of all mankind. (Islam101) 
		<p><a href="http://www.almasjid.com/content/story_adam_and_eve">Summary of the story of Adam and Eve from the Qur'an</a>
		<h3>Muhammad</h3>
		<p>Unique to Islam is Muhammad, who Muslims believe to be the greatest of all prophets. According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad was given the complete Qur'an by Allah and that he himself simply presented it to the world, thus preventing the Qur'an from being distorted or corrupted by men.</p>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad">Further reading on the Prophet Muhammad from Wikipedia</a>
		<h3>Other Prophets</h3>
		<p>Islamic tradition states that there are many other prophets, though the exact number is uncertain. Four are mentioned specifically in the Qur'an, but are never named. Other sources have stated that there may be as many as 124,000 other prophets. Overall, the only agreement among scholarly sources is that the exact number is Muslim prophets is not known with any certainty. (Wikipedia)</p>
		
		<h2>Principal Beliefs</h2>
		<p>Islamic beliefs are based on five main tenets, referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Pillars_of_Islam">Five Pillars</a>.</p>
		<h3>Testimony</h3>
		<p>The <a href="http://www.religionfacts.com/shahada">Shahada</a>, which is the basic creed of Islam that must be recited under oath with the specific statement: "I testify that there is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God." This testament is a foundation for all other beliefs and practices in Islam. Muslims must repeat the shahadah in prayer, and non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the creed.</p>
		<p>This sort profession of faith is very similar to the Catholic profession of faith, which is recited during each mass.</p>
		<h3>Prayer</h3>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah"><img src="http://hadeethoftheday.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Praying-on-Time-Between-Deep-Faith-Fashionable-Identity.jpg" alt="Muslims praying in a Mosque" 
		style="height:300px" title="Muslims praying in a Mosque"></a>
		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah">Ritual prayers</a>, called Salah or Salat, must be performed five times a day. Salat is intended to focus the mind on God, and is seen as a personal
		communication with him that expresses gratitude and worship. Salat is compulsory but flexibility in the specifics is allowed depending on circumstances.
		The prayers are recited in the Arabic language, and consist of verses from the Qur'an. The prayers are done with the chest in direction of the Kaaba, though in the early days of Islam,
		they were done in direction of Jerusalem.</p>
		<p>A mosque is a place of worship for Muslims, who often refer to it by its Arabic name, masjid. The word mosque in English refers to all types of buildings dedicated to Islamic worship, although there is a distinction in Arabic between the smaller, privately owned mosque and the larger, "collective" mosque. Although the primary purpose of the mosque is to serve as a place of prayer, it is also important to the Muslim community as a place to meet and study. In Medina, Al-Masjid al-Nabawi, or the Prophet's Mosque, was also a place of refuge for the poor.</p>
		<p>The architecture of modern mosques has evolved greatly from the early designs of the 7th century, and often contain a variety of distinctive architectural elements such as minarets.</p>
		<h3>Alms-Giving</h3>
		<p>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakat">Zakat</a>" is the contribution of a portion of one's accumulated wealth by all Muslims who can afford to do so. This contribution is used to help the poor and needy, and "also, for bringing hearts together, freeing captives, for those in debt (or bonded labour) and for the (stranded) traveller."</p>
		<p>This contribution is a religious obligation, as opposed to voluntary charity. The annual Zakat is estimated to be 15 times more than global humanitarian aid contributions each year. The amount each person (excluding the poor and needy) is expected to contribute is 2.5% of the value of all capital assets that the person holds. Muslims are also urged-but not required-to voluntarily give more.</p>
		<h3>Fasting</h3>
		<p>Fasting, from food and drink (among other things) must be performed from dawn to dusk during the holy month of Ramadhan. 
		The fast is to encourage a feeling of nearness to God, and during it Muslims should express their gratitude for and dependence on him,
		atone for their past sins, and think of the needy. Fasting is not compulsory for several people for whom it would constitute an undue burden, such as the sick, the young, and the elderly. For others, flexibility is allowed depending on circumstances, but missed fasts usually must be made up.</p>
		<h3>Pilgrimage</h3>
		<p>The pilgrimage, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj">Hajj</a>, has to be done during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah in the city of Mecca. 
		Every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it must make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in his or her lifetime. 
		Rituals of the Hajj include: spending a day and a night in the tents in the desert plain of Mina, then a day in the desert plain of Arafat praying and worshiping God, 
		following the foot steps of Abraham. Then spending a night out in the open, sleeping on the desert sand in the desert plain of Muzdalifah, then moving to Jamarat, 
		symbolically stoning the Devil recounting Abraham's actions. Then going to Mecca and walking seven times around the Kaaba which Muslims believe was built as a place of worship by Abraham. 
		Then walking seven times between Mount Safa and Mount Marwah recounting the steps of Abraham's wife, while she was looking for water for her son Ismael in the desert before Mecca developed into a settlement.</p>
